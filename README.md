<h1>Boston Bus Tracker Project:</h1> This is my bus tracker project. This generates a map with several pins which represent active MBTA buses. The pins will move every 10 seconds
and reflect the new updated coordinates of the bus.  
<h1>Description:</h1> This project pulls live data from the MBTA data source and is used to represent the real time location of the buses, I plan on adding additional features
to this project like numbering the buses and adding a directional arrow to point where the bus is heading.
<h1>Usage:</h1> Click this <a href= "https://amato1891.github.io">Link<a/> to watch the real time bus tracker in action.
<h1>Support:</h1> Any questions? Contact me at Amato1892@yahoo.com
